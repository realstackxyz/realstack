# Asset Verification Process

## Overview

The RealStack asset verification process is designed to ensure that all tokenized assets on the platform are legitimate, properly valued, and legally compliant. This rigorous process creates trust in the platform and protects investors by providing transparency and due diligence for every listed asset.

## Verification Principles

The RealStack verification process follows these core principles:

1. **Multi-Layer Verification**: Assets undergo multiple verification steps by different parties
2. **Expert Validation**: Industry-specific experts evaluate each asset
3. **Documentation Requirements**: Comprehensive documentation must be provided and verified
4. **Ongoing Monitoring**: Continued verification and updates after initial onboarding
5. **Transparency**: Verification status and details visible to all users

## Verification Process

### Stage 1: Initial Submission

The asset owner submits their asset for tokenization with the following information:

- Asset identification and ownership documents
- Detailed description and specifications
- Historical information and provenance
- Current valuation estimate and supporting documentation
- Proposed tokenization structure
- Legal status and any encumbrances

This information undergoes an initial review by the RealStack team to ensure completeness.

### Stage 2: Expert Assessment

Based on the asset type, the appropriate expert verifiers are assigned:

| Asset Type | Expert Verifiers |
|------------|------------------|
| Real Estate | Licensed appraisers, property inspectors |
| Art & Collectibles | Art experts, authentication specialists |
| Business Equity | Financial analysts, industry specialists |
| Vehicles | Certified mechanics, specialty appraisers |
| Intellectual Property | IP lawyers, industry valuators |

The verifiers conduct their assessment, which may include:

- Physical inspection of the asset
- Documentation review and verification
- Comparable market analysis
- Income approach valuation (if applicable)
- Replacement cost assessment (if applicable)
- Legal status confirmation

### Stage 3: Valuation Confirmation

The asset undergoes a formal valuation process:

1. **Initial Appraisal**: Expert-led valuation based on industry standards
2. **Peer Review**: Secondary review by another expert
3. **Market Testing**: For certain assets, preliminary market feedback
4. **Final Valuation**: Determination of the asset's value for tokenization

The valuation methodology is documented and becomes part of the asset's permanent record.

### Stage 4: Legal Verification

Legal experts review the asset to ensure:

- Clear title and ownership rights
- No undisclosed liens or encumbrances
- Regulatory compliance for the asset type
- Proper legal structure for tokenization
- Jurisdictional requirements are met
- Appropriate SPV (Special Purpose Vehicle) structure if needed

### Stage 5: Tokenization Approval

Once all verifications are complete, the tokenization proposal undergoes final review:

- Verification reports are compiled and reviewed
- Tokenization structure is finalized
- Legal documentation is prepared
- Smart contract parameters are set
- Asset is approved for tokenization

### Stage 6: Ongoing Verification

After tokenization, the asset undergoes periodic re-verification:

- Regular valuation updates (frequency depends on asset type)
- Compliance checks and monitoring
- Physical inspections where applicable
- Financial performance tracking (for income-generating assets)

## Verification Status Levels

## Introduction

This document provides secure coding guidelines for developers working on the RealStack blockchain platform. Following these guidelines will help minimize security vulnerabilities and protect user assets. Security is a continuous process that should be integrated throughout the development lifecycle, not just as a final check before deployment.

## General Security Principles

### Defense in Depth

1. **Multiple Security Layers**: Implement multiple security controls at different levels of the application.
2. **Trust Boundaries**: Clearly identify trust boundaries in your application and ensure proper validation when crossing them.
3. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Code, processes, and users should operate with the minimum privileges necessary.
4. **Complete Mediation**: Verify access rights on every request to a resource.

### Secure Defaults

1. **Secure by Default**: Use secure default configurations and enable security features by default.
2. **Deny by Default**: Start with restrictive policies and only permit specific, required operations.
3. **Simplicity**: Security-critical code should be simple, making it easier to review and understand.

### Assume the Environment is Hostile

1. **Untrusted Input**: Treat all input as untrusted and potentially malicious, regardless of source.
2. **Network Level Threats**: Assume the network is hostile and can be tampered with.
3. **Internal Threats**: Design with the understanding that any part of the system might be compromised.

## Input Validation

### Input Validation Principles

1. **Validate All Inputs**: Always validate input regardless of its source.
2. **Validation Strategy**: Use a combination of:
   - Allowlist validation (only accept known good input)
   - Data type validation
   - Range validation
   - Format validation
   - Schema validation
3. **Input Validation Location**: Validate input at both the client and server side.
4. **Validation Libraries**: Use established validation libraries rather than writing custom validation code.

### Preventing Common Injection Attacks

1. **SQL Injection**:
   - Use parameterized queries or prepared statements
   - Implement ORM frameworks properly
   - Validate input for expected types and patterns

2. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**:
   - Encode output based on context (HTML, JavaScript, CSS, URL)
   - Use Content-Security-Policy headers
   - Apply framework-specific protections

3. **Command Injection**:
   - Avoid passing user input to system commands
   - If unavoidable, use strict allowlists for permitted values
   - Use libraries that execute commands safely

4. **JSON/XML Injection**:
   - Validate all data against a strict schema
   - Use safe deserializers that don't execute code
   - Avoid eval() and similar dynamic code execution functions

## Authentication and Authorization

### Authentication Best Practices

1. **Password Security**:
   - Enforce strong password policies (complexity, length)
   - Store passwords using strong, adaptive hashing algorithms (Argon2, bcrypt)
   - Implement account lockout after failed attempts
   - Support multi-factor authentication

2. **Session Management**:
   - Generate strong, random session identifiers
   - Regenerate session IDs after privilege changes
   - Implement session timeout and idle timeout
   - Allow users to view and terminate active sessions

3. **Secure Communication**:
   - Use HTTPS for all authentication
   - Implement certificate pinning where appropriate
   - Protect authentication cookies with Secure and HttpOnly flags

### Authorization Implementation

1. **Access Control Design**:
   - Implement role-based access control (RBAC)
   - Use attribute-based access control (ABAC) for complex requirements
   - Apply principle of least privilege to role design
   - Check authorization at the resource/service level, not just UI level

2. **Common Pitfalls to Avoid**:
   - Insecure direct object references
   - Missing function level access control
   - Horizontal and vertical privilege escalation vulnerabilities
   - Assuming authorization at one layer means authorization at all layers

3. **JWT Security (if used)**:
   - Use appropriate algorithms (RS256 preferred over HS256)
   - Validate all claims in tokens
   - Implement short expiration times
   - Include only necessary data in tokens

## Session Management

1. **Session Security**:
   - Use the framework's session management when available
   - Apply appropriate cookie security settings
   - Implement CSRF protection mechanisms
   - Invalidate sessions after logout or timeout

2. **Session Storage**:
   - Store session data securely on the server
   - Encrypt sensitive session data
   - Consider using distributed session storage for scalability

3. **Session Expiration**:
   - Set appropriate absolute and idle timeout periods
   - Provide graceful session expiration handling
   - Allow users to extend sessions when appropriate

## Data Protection

## Introduction

Welcome to the RealStack User Security Guide. This guide is designed to help you understand security best practices in the blockchain world to protect your digital assets and personal information. Whether you are new to blockchain or an experienced user, these security recommendations will help you guard against potential security threats.

While blockchain technology offers unprecedented security and transparency, users must remain vigilant. This guide will help you understand potential risks and take appropriate preventive measures.

## Account Security

### Strong Password Practices

1. **Use Strong Passwords**: Create complex passwords of at least 12 characters, including uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special symbols.
2. **Avoid Common Passwords**: Don't use easily guessable passwords like "password123", birthdays, or common phrases.
3. **Regularly Change Passwords**: Recommended to change passwords every 3-6 months.
4. **Don't Reuse Passwords**: Use different passwords for different platforms.
5. **Consider Using a Password Manager**: Securely store and manage your complex passwords.

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

1. **Always Enable MFA**: This is one of the most effective methods to prevent account theft.
2. **Use Secure MFA Methods**: Prefer authentication apps (like Google Authenticator, Authy) over SMS verification codes.
3. **Securely Back Up MFA Recovery Codes**: Store recovery codes in a safe place in case you lose access.
4. **Regularly Verify MFA Settings**: Ensure your recovery email and phone number are always up to date.

### Account Recovery

1. **Set Up Secure Recovery Options**: Use secure email and phone numbers as recovery options.
2. **Understand Account Recovery Process**: Familiarize yourself with the platform's account recovery steps in advance.
3. **Protect Recovery Email**: Ensure the email used for account recovery also has strong password and MFA protection.

## Wallet Security

### Wallet Types and Selection

1. **Understand Different Wallet Types**:
   - **Hot Wallets**: Connected wallets, such as mobile or web wallets, convenient for daily use but less secure.
   - **Cold Wallets**: Offline wallets, such as hardware wallets, providing higher security, suitable for storing large assets.
   - **Paper Wallets**: Completely offline paper records of private keys, high security but inconvenient to use.

2. **Multi-Wallet Strategy**:
   - Store most assets in cold wallets.
   - Keep only small amounts needed for daily transactions in hot wallets.
   - Consider using multi-signature wallets to protect important assets.

### Private Key Management

1. **Your Private Key is Everything**: Whoever has the private key has control of the assets.
2. **Never Share Your Private Key**: Never reveal your private key or seed phrase to anyone under any circumstances.
3. **Secure Storage**:
   - Hardware wallets are one of the most secure ways to store private keys.
   - Consider splitting your seed phrase into parts and storing them in different physical locations.
   - For paper backups, consider using fireproof and waterproof storage methods.

### Hardware Wallet Usage Guide

1. **Purchase Channel**: Only purchase hardware wallets from official channels or authorized dealers.
2. **Tampering Check**: Check for signs of tampering upon receiving a hardware wallet.
3. **Firmware Updates**: Regularly update hardware wallet firmware, but only through the official app.
4. **Physical Security**: Store hardware wallets in a secure physical location, such as a safe.

## Transaction Security

### Transaction Verification

1. **Carefully Check Transaction Details**:
   - Confirm the receiving address is correct (check the complete address, not just the first few and last few digits).
   - Verify the amount being sent is accurate.
   - Check if the transaction fee is reasonable.

2. **Use Test Transactions**: Before sending large amounts to a new address for the first time, conduct a small test transaction.

3. **Confirm Platform Security**: Use trusted transaction platforms and wallet applications, especially noting if the URL is correct and using HTTPS.

### Transaction Monitoring

1. **Track Your Transactions**: Use blockchain explorers to monitor transaction status and confirmations.
2. **Set Up Notifications**: Configure wallets or use third-party services to receive notifications when your address receives or sends funds.
3. **Understand Transaction Confirmations**: Wait for a sufficient number of confirmations based on the characteristics of different blockchains to confirm the transaction is final.

### Smart Contract Interaction

1. **Be Cautious with Authorizations**: When interacting with smart contracts, carefully check the authorization scope.
2. **Read Audit Reports**: Use smart contracts that have undergone security audits whenever possible.
3. **Guard Against Flash Loan Attacks**: Understand flash loan attack principles and be cautious when using new or unverified DeFi protocols.

## Preventing Phishing and Scams

### Identifying Phishing Attempts

1. **Check URLs**: Confirm the website URL is correct, watch for spelling errors or similar but different domain names.
2. **Official Channels**: Only download apps and access services through official channels.
3. **Beware of Social Media**: Don't click on suspicious links on social media platforms, especially those promising high-return investments or airdrops.

### Common Scam Types

1. **Airdrop Scams**: Requiring you to send funds to "verify" your address or receive more tokens in an airdrop.
2. **Customer Service Scams**: Impersonating customer service personnel asking you to provide private keys or transfer funds to a "secure wallet".
3. **Fake Websites**: Websites that look similar to legitimate platforms, aimed at stealing your login credentials or private keys.
4. **Investment Scams**: Investment projects promising unrealistically high returns.

### Protective Measures

1. **Official Apps**: Use official apps from app stores rather than downloading from other channels.
2. **Bookmark Important Websites**: Add commonly used cryptocurrency exchanges and wallet websites to bookmarks, rather than accessing through search engines.
3. **Directly Enter URLs**: Directly type the web address in the browser, rather than clicking links in emails or social media.
4. **Anti-Phishing Code**: Remember and verify your anti-phishing code (if the platform provides one).

## Device Security

### Mobile Device Security

1. **Keep Systems Updated**: Regularly install security updates for operating systems and applications.
2. **Use Secure Lock Screens**: Configure strong passwords, PINs, or biometric lock screens.
3. **Be Careful with App Installation**: Only download apps from official app stores, check app permissions.
4. **Antivirus Protection**: Consider using mobile antivirus software.

### Computer Security

1. **Antivirus and Firewall**: Use reliable antivirus software and enable firewalls.
2. **Regular Backups**: Regularly back up important data to secure offline storage.
3. **Be Mindful of Browser Extensions**: Only install necessary and trusted browser extensions, regularly check and clean.
4. **Beware of Public Wi-Fi**: Use VPNs to protect public network connections, avoid performing sensitive operations on public Wi-Fi.

### Dedicated Device Considerations

1. **Consider Using Dedicated Devices**: Use dedicated devices for cryptocurrency management, not for daily browsing or other activities.
2. **Secure Boot**: Consider using bootable secure operating systems (such as Tails) for highly sensitive operations.

## Recovery and Backups

### Backup Strategy

1. **Back Up Private Keys and Seed Phrases**: Create secure backups of private keys or seed phrases.
2. **3-2-1 Backup Principle**: Create at least 3 backups, stored on 2 different media types, with 1 backup stored off-site.
3. **Avoid Digital Backups**: Prioritize physical backups over digital formats (don't save in cloud storage or email).

### Secure Backup Methods

1. **Metal Backups**: Consider using metal plates to engrave seed phrases, making them waterproof and fireproof.
2. **Multiple Locations**: Store backups in different secure locations, reducing the risk of single point failure.
3. **Regular Verification**: Periodically check the readability and integrity of backups.

### Backup Access Control

1. **Consider Estate Planning**: Make a plan to ensure trusted individuals can access your assets when necessary.
2. **Share Access Mechanisms, Not Private Keys**: Design a mechanism that allows trusted people to access backups only when necessary, rather than directly sharing private keys.

## Privacy Protection

### Transaction Privacy

1. **Understand Blockchain Transparency**: Transactions on most blockchains are publicly visible.
2. **Use New Addresses**: Consider using different addresses for different transactions to prevent all assets and transactions from being linked.
3. **Coin Mixing Service Considerations**: Be aware of the legal and security risks of coin mixing services.

### Identity Protection

1. **Limited Personal Information Sharing**: Share as little personal information as possible in the crypto community.
2. **Use Pseudonyms**: Consider using pseudonyms on public forums and social media.
3. **Beware of Social Engineering**: Be alert to attempts to gain your sensitive information by building relationships or trust.

## Common Threats and Defenses

   Defense: Use antivirus software, consider using virtual keyboards for entering sensitive information.

2. **Clipboard Hijacking**: Replaces cryptocurrency addresses in the clipboard.
   Defense: Verify the complete address after pasting a crypto address.

3. **Fake Wallet Apps**: Malicious apps disguised as legitimate wallets.
   Defense: Only download wallet apps from official sources, verify developers.

### Social Engineering

1. **Urgency and Pressure**: Scammers create a sense of urgency to make you act without fully thinking.
   Defense: Be suspicious of any request urging you to act immediately.

2. **Too Good to Be True Offers**: Investment opportunities promising unrealistic returns.
   Defense: Remember "if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is" and be wary of unusually high returns.

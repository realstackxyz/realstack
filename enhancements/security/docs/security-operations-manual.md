## Introduction

### Purpose and Scope

This security operations manual is designed to provide a comprehensive guide to security management practices for the RealStack blockchain application operations team. It covers all aspects from daily operations to emergency response, ensuring that our platform maintains the highest level of security and reliability.

### Security Philosophy

RealStack's security philosophy is built on the following core principles:

1. **Defense in Depth**: Implement multi-layered security controls to ensure that a single point of failure does not compromise the entire system.
2. **Least Privilege**: Provide users and system components with the minimum access privileges needed to complete their tasks.
3. **Secure by Default**: All system configurations default to secure states, requiring explicit actions to reduce security levels.
4. **Continuous Improvement**: Strengthen security measures through ongoing assessment, testing, and updates.
5. **Privacy Protection**: User data privacy is a core consideration in design and operational decisions.
